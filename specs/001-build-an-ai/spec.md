# Feature Specification: AI Schedule Counseling Conversational Assistant

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-ai`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an AI schedule counseling application that improves a user's schedule. The core interaction is a back-and-forth out-loud dialog with a conversational AI. The user states their problem or desired change (e.g. 'My Tuesdays are too hectic,' 'I'm not getting enough sleep'), and the AI considers their events and asks questions to gain more insight until it can propose a new schedule. The user's current schedule (a week or a day depending on their focus) is displayed in one panel, while the proposed schedule is shown in a second panel. A third panel shows an impersonal visual representation of the AI and a transcript. The schedule syncs to and from Google Calendar."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An individual user wants help improving their personal schedule (day or week). They open the application, see their current schedule imported from Google Calendar, voice a concern such as "My Tuesdays are too hectic" or "I'm not getting enough sleep." The system engages them in a spoken back‚Äëand‚Äëforth dialog, asking clarifying questions (e.g., "Which Tuesday activities feel least essential?" or "What time do you currently go to bed?"). After enough clarification, the system presents a proposed adjusted schedule side‚Äëby‚Äëside with the current one. The user can iterate by approving, rejecting particular changes, or requesting modifications ("Move the workout earlier", "Protect 8 hours of sleep"). Once satisfied, the user approves and the proposed schedule changes can be synced back to Google Calendar.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with a connected Google Calendar and a displayed current weekly schedule, **When** they state a scheduling problem verbally (e.g., "My Tuesdays are too hectic"), **Then** the system MUST acknowledge the concern verbally/textually and ask at least one clarifying question referencing existing events.
2. **Given** the user has answered clarifying questions, **When** the system has sufficient information, **Then** it MUST produce a proposed schedule variant showing modifications (additions, removals, moves, or time adjustments) in a separate panel without altering the original schedule yet.
3. **Given** a proposed schedule is displayed, **When** the user requests a targeted change ("Shift my run to mornings"), **Then** the proposal MUST update to reflect the requested adjustment while preserving unrelated prior accepted adjustments.
4. **Given** the user approves the proposal, **When** they confirm finalization, **Then** the system MUST sync the approved changes to Google Calendar (creating, deleting, or updating events) and visually mark the proposal as applied.
5. **Given** network or calendar API failure occurs during sync, **When** the user attempts to apply changes, **Then** the system MUST notify the user of the failure and leave original calendar data untouched.
6. **Given** the user focuses on a single day view, **When** they express a broad weekly concern ("I want more balance across the week"), **Then** the system MUST prompt whether to switch to week context or proceed with day‚Äëonly adjustments. 

### Edge Cases
- User provides an extremely vague problem ("Make it better"): system asks for clarification and does not generate a proposal until at least one concrete constraint or goal is captured. 
- User rejects multiple consecutive proposals: system summarizes what has been tried and asks for new constraints to reduce iteration fatigue.
- Calendar has overlapping or duplicate events: system flags conflicts and may propose resolving overlaps before broader optimization. 
- User revokes Google Calendar permission mid‚Äësession: system halts further sync proposals and clearly indicates that changes cannot be applied until reconnected. 
- Long periods with no events (e.g., open afternoons): system asks whether to preserve open time or (hackathon assumption) may optionally suggest a single generic "Focus / Rest" block; no automatic multi-category generation.
- User expresses sleep concern but no sleep events exist: system asks typical sleep schedule and desired target before proposing changes. 
- Time zone change between sessions: system uses Google Calendar's primary time zone each session; if user device TZ differs it displays a banner offering a one-click alignment; no historical conversion.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## MVP Scope & Phased Roadmap
This section classifies Functional Requirements for a hackathon demo emphasizing a polished conversational scheduling experience with clear visual differentiation and safe calendar interaction.

Principles:
- Demo Impact: Visibly impressive within first 2 minutes (voice/problem input ‚Üí clarified ‚Üí proposal appears side-by-side).
- Feasibility: Implementable with lightweight engineering (avoid deep optimization algorithms beyond heuristics).
- Safety: Non-destructive calendar changes with explicit user control.
- Polish over breadth: Fewer features executed cleanly instead of incomplete breadth.

MVP (Demo MUST show): FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, FR-004, FR-005, FR-006, FR-008, FR-010 (basic rationale), FR-011, FR-012, FR-019, FR-020, FR-022, FR-024.

Modified-for-MVP (lightweight form):
- FR-007: If implemented, allow simple per-change checkbox or fallback to whole-proposal accept.
- FR-009: Sequential sync with error list (no advanced rollback UI).
- FR-021: Basic export button if time allows (plain .txt already defined).

Stretch (Add if time remains): FR-013, FR-014, FR-015, FR-016, FR-017, FR-018, FR-021 (if omitted), FR-023.

Future (Out of hackathon scope): Advanced scheduling optimization (e.g., constraint solver), multi-user collaboration, long-term analytics, ML personalization beyond heuristics.

Visual / Interaction Priorities:
1. Immediate calendar load + side-by-side current vs proposed.
2. Conversational panel: speech ‚Üí transcript ‚Üí AI question under 2s target.
3. Diff highlighting for add/move/remove.
4. Approve flow with clear confirmation + success indicator.
5. Rationale snippet per changed event.

Suggested Demo Script:
1. User: "My Tuesdays are too hectic." ‚Üí Clarifying question.
2. User answers specifying meeting + sleep goal.
3. Proposal appears with 3 change types.
4. User refines one change.
5. Approve ‚Üí sync indicator.

Qualitative Demo KPIs:
- First proposal under 60s from start.
- ‚â•1 clarifying question before proposal.
- 3 distinct change types shown.
- Immediate visual comprehension of differences.

Post-Demo Expansion Order: FR-013 (Undo) ‚Üí FR-017 (Priorities) ‚Üí FR-016 (Sleep conflicts) ‚Üí FR-023 (Retry/backoff robustness) ‚Üí FR-014 (Iteration cap UI) ‚Üí FR-018 (Preference persistence) ‚Üí FR-015 (Large block confirmation sophistication).

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST ingest and display the user's current schedule (day and week views) sourced from Google Calendar without modifying events on initial load.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable a user to articulate a scheduling problem or goal via spoken input and capture a transcript.
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate at least one clarifying question when the initial problem statement lacks actionable parameters (e.g., intensity, time constraints, goals).
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain an iterative dialog history transcript visible in the third panel.
- **FR-005**: System MUST produce a proposed schedule that highlights differences from the current schedule (e.g., moved events, added blocks, removed events) without committing changes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow the user to request modifications to the proposal using natural language (e.g., "Move the workout to 7 AM"), updating the proposal accordingly.
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow selective acceptance or rejection of individual proposed changes before final approval (granularity = per event/change item; batch accept all also available).
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow the user to approve the complete proposed schedule, triggering synchronization of changes back to Google Calendar.
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle sync operations atomically per event: failed updates must not partially corrupt unaffected events and must report which failed.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide summary rationale for each proposed change (e.g., "Moved Lunch earlier to ensure 8-hour sleep window").
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow user to switch context between day view and week view; proposals must reflect the currently active context.
- **FR-012**: System MUST warn the user before discarding an in-progress proposal when switching context or starting a new problem statement.
- **FR-013**: System MUST support undo of the last applied proposal within the current browser session only (no persistence after page reload).
- **FR-014**: System MUST log each proposal iteration count and, after 5 iterations without approval, prompt the user to refine constraints or accept best effort.
- **FR-015**: System MUST request explicit confirmation before creating or deleting any calendar event longer than 60 minutes.
- **FR-016**: System MUST flag potential health/sleep conflicts when requested changes reduce estimated sleep below 7 hours (default minimum target adjustable by user preference).
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow user to specify up to 5 priorities (sleep, exercise, focus work, social, recovery) ranked by drag-and-drop order (higher = more protected) influencing proposals.
- **FR-018**: System MUST persist user preference settings for priorities and constraints for the duration of the hackathon demo only (in local storage) and allow a one-click "Clear Preferences" action.
- **FR-019**: System MUST display a non-anthropomorphized AI visual (neutral avatar or waveform) without implying human identity.
- **FR-020**: System MUST differentiate clearly between current and proposed schedule using color + side-by-side panels meeting WCAG AA contrast for text and event color badges.
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide a transcript export option as a downloadable plain text (.txt) file for the active session only (not stored server-side post session end).
- **FR-022**: System MUST obtain user consent before first syncing changes to Google Calendar referencing the scope of modifications.
- **FR-023**: System MUST recover gracefully from network loss by retrying failed event syncs up to 3 times with exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) then presenting a manual "Retry All" button.
- **FR-024**: System MUST restrict actions to users authenticated exclusively via Google OAuth (using only the minimal required scopes including Calendar read/write). Other auth providers are explicitly out of scope for this feature iteration.

*All prior ambiguity markers have been resolved with explicit hackathon-scope assumptions.*

### Hackathon Assumptions (Consolidated)
1. Suggestion scope: only one generic optional "Focus / Rest" block in large empty spans; no rich category synthesis.
2. Time zone: always align to Google Calendar primary TZ; show banner if browser differs; no historical conversion logic.
3. Selective acceptance: per event/change item plus bulk accept all.
4. Undo: single-level undo of last applied proposal; lost on reload.
5. Iteration cap: prompt user after 5 proposal revisions without approval.
6. Significant event threshold: 60 minutes.
7. Minimum sleep target: 7 hours default (user adjustable).
8. Priority model: up to 5 predefined categories ordered by drag-and-drop.
9. Preference persistence: local storage only; cleared manually; no server retention guarantees.
10. Accessibility: commit to WCAG AA color contrast for schedule differentiation.
11. Transcript export: plain text download only; ephemeral.
12. Network retry: 3 attempts with 2s, 4s, 8s backoff then manual retry option.
13. Authentication: Google OAuth only; minimal Calendar scopes.
