# Implementation Plan: AI Schedule Counseling Conversational Assistant

**Branch**: `001-build-an-ai` | **Date**: 2025-10-04 | **Spec**: [/Users/axelsoderquist/development/HackHarvardTeam/specs/001-build-an-ai/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-ai/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Conversational assistant that ingests a user's Google Calendar (day/week), gathers clarifications about a scheduling concern, and proposes non-destructive schedule changes side-by-side. MVP emphasizes rapid, voice-driven dialogue, clear diff visualization, selective acceptance, and safe application of changes back to Google Calendar. Technical approach: Single Next.js (TypeScript) app with Tailwind; Gemini prompts generate structured proposal JSON; ElevenLabs provides TTS for system utterances; OAuth Google Calendar integration for read/write with per-event atomic sync + retry/backoff.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript / Node 18 (Next.js latest)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, NextAuth.js (Google), Gemini API client (fetch), ElevenLabs TTS (REST), Zod (validation), (optional) Zustand or React Context only  
**Storage**: None server-side; localStorage for PreferenceSet; transient in-memory state  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (smoke/integration), inline assertions  
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop Chrome for demo; fallback text input for unsupported speech browsers)  
**Project Type**: Single web application (frontend + lightweight API routes)  
**Performance Goals**: First clarifying question < 2s subjective; first proposal < 60s from session start; TTS playback start < 1.5s after text ready  
**Constraints**: Minimal scope, no DB, atomic per-event sync, WCAG AA contrast, single undo level, retry backoff 2s/4s/8s  
**Scale/Scope**: Hackathon demo (single user session; small calendars < 200 events considered)

## Constitution Check
Initial Review (Pre-Phase 0): PASS  
Post-Design Review (After Phase 1): PASS  

Alignment:
- Rapid Iteration: Single Next.js app, no microservices.
- Scope Discipline: Only MVP FR list + selective acceptance (lightweight) + undo (single level).
- Minimal Reliable Quality: Targeted tests (proposal schema, diff, sleep check) + smoke.
- Transparent Communication: Decisions captured in `research.md`.
- Ethical/Responsible: Keys server-side only; no PII stored.

No violations requiring Complexity Tracking.

**Structure Decision**: Adopt consolidated single Next.js application with feature-oriented directories; API routes map directly to OpenAPI paths; minimal lib/* modules for logic separation consistent with hackathon timebox.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach (Preview Only)
Will transform: FR list + OpenAPI + data model into tasks. Emphasis on:
1. Contract validation tests before route stubs.
2. Schema & diff utilities before proposal generation integration.
3. Conversation loop (clarify → generate) prior to selective acceptance UI.
4. Sync + undo after base proposal display stable.
Parallelization: Independent utility modules & unit tests flagged [P]; UI components after schemas to enable prop typing reuse.
Expected Count: ~26 tasks (8 tests, 6 API route stubs, 5 UI components, 4 utilities, 2 integration flows, 1 polish/accessibility).

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
